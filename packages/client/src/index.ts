/**
 * @webpieces/client - Umbrella package for client-side dependencies
 *
 * This is a Maven-style umbrella package that installs all client-side dependencies.
 * Do not import from this package directly. Instead, import from constituent packages:
 *
 * @example
 * import { createApiClient } from '@webpieces/http-client';
 * import { ApiInterface, Post, Get } from '@webpieces/http-api';
 */

// This file exists only to satisfy build requirements.
// Users should import from constituent packages, not from this umbrella package.
