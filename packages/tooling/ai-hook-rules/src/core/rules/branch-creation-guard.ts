     *      `git worktree remove` FAILS on those, so it cannot be the first step.
     *   2. `git worktree remove <path>` — one path per invocation; git takes no path list here.
     *   3. `git branch -D <names>` — only now. git flatly refuses to delete a branch that is still
     *      checked out in a worktree, so a branch delete placed before the removal fails, and because
     *      it is one multi-name command it takes every other branch in the list down with it.
