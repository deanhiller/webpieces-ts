/**
 * @webpieces/server - Umbrella package for server-side dependencies
 *
 * This is a Maven-style umbrella package that installs all server-side dependencies.
 * Do not import from this package directly. Instead, import from constituent packages:
 *
 * @example
 * import { WebpiecesServer } from '@webpieces/http-server';
 * import { Controller } from '@webpieces/http-routing';
 */

// This file exists only to satisfy build requirements.
// Users should import from constituent packages, not from this umbrella package.
